 Make your city as beautiful as Rivendell (Lord of the Rings reference)

Rivendell believes in inspiring people and pushing them to save the environment. But for times when inspiring isn't enough, giving incentive does th job. 

Rivendell is a website that does exactly what the previous statement says.
For inspiration, we have an *events page*, that is a list of all the drives happening in and around the city. An individual can learn about them, and also be a part of any event, he wishes to.

Another feature this website provides is *carpool*.
The entire functionality of a carpool is built right into the website, and anyone who has a car and drives, can car pool with any other person, and in the process can earn some money.

The entire project is open source. The code can be downloaded and modified in any way for educational purposes. To use the code for any business, explicit permission is required from us.
